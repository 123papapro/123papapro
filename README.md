<description>2024-01-14 3 shortcuts Shift-DEL (Cut), Ctrl-INS (Copy) and Shift-INS (Paste) are restored in the release 8.6.2 (they were removed from v8.6.1). A regression is fixed in this release for the shortcut Ctrl-V not being able to paste clipboard content into the text fields of certain plugins. &ldquo;disableLineCopyCutDelete.xml&rdquo;, which was introduced in v8.6.1, is canceled in this release v8.6.2 - this empty file is not necessary anymore because the concerning shorcuts conflict/problem has been solved in this release.</description>

<description>2024-01-05 In the previous version v8.6, we introduced the &ldquo;column mode to multi-editing&rdquo; to enhance the user experience for Notepad++ users. However, it&rsquo;s impossible to make every user happy with any new feature of the software, so an option is added to disable the &ldquo;column mode to multi-editing&rdquo;. Also another option is added in v8.6.1 to disable the shortcuts for copying/cutting/deleting an entire line when there&rsquo;s no selection, and add back Shift-DEL &amp; Ctrl-INS shortcuts.</description>

<description>2023-11-23 Today marks the 20th anniversary of Notepad++ (November 23, 2003), when it launched its first version (v1.0) on SourceForge: From v1.0 to the current v8.6, there have been 238 official releases (excluding some releases that were withdrawn due to critical bugs). I still recall that between the v1.x and the v2.0, I repeatedly signed up on various websites, so that I could spam the forums with &ldquo;Notepad++ is awesome!</description>
